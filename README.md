# Air Quality Analysis Project

This project analyzes air quality data using Python, focusing on various pollutants and their trends across different cities.

## Features

- Data cleaning and manipulation using Pandas and NumPy
- Creation of pivot tables for data transformation
- Comprehensive data visualization including:
  - Line plots for pollutant trends
  - Box plots and strip plots for distribution analysis
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Bar plots for city-wise pollution levels
  - Scatter plots comparing PM2.5 and PM10 levels
- Air Quality Index (AQI) categorization

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahilkr28/Air-Quality.git
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dataset "AirQuality Python Dataset.csv" in the project directory
2. Run the script:
```bash
python "Air Quality.py"
```

## Visualizations

The script generates various visualizations including:
- Temporal trends of PM2.5 and PM10
- Distribution of different pollutants
- Correlation between pollutants
- City-wise pollution levels
- PM2.5 vs PM10 scatter plots
- AQI category distribution
